# Portfolio Website hosted on Github

## How does this work?

The Website is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) a Framework generate static HTML Files from Markdown.

So.. everytime a push is made to this repository an action workflow is triggered that creates an HTML Website which is then commited to the gh-pages branch.
The Content of the ph-pages branch is deployed via the GitHub Pages service.
